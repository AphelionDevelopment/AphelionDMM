# Architecture

## Current application

AphelionDMM retains StrongDMM's desktop and rendering subsystems. The current
editor routes committed map edits through Aphelion's operation engine:

```text
Dear ImGui UI
    -> editor tools
    -> mutable dmmap.Dmm gesture/display state
    -> explicit tile operation -> local or network executor
    -> acknowledged snapshot -> staged, validated DMM/TGM save

Accepted history -> actor-scoped inverse operation for undo
Display refresh -> dmmsnap compatibility copy and render invalidation

Go application
    -> cgo/static library boundary
    -> vendored Rust sdmmparser
```

Important existing seams include:

- `main.go` and `internal/app` for application lifecycle.
- `internal/app/ui/cpwsarea/wsmap/pmap/editor` for map editing and commits.
- `internal/dmapi/dmmap` for the mutable map model.
- `internal/dmapi/dmmsnap` for snapshot-derived undo/redo.
- `internal/dmapi/dmmap/dmmdata` for DMM/TGM parse and write behavior.
- `third_party/sdmmparser` for the Rust parser boundary.

`Editor.CommitOperation` captures explicit before/after tile changes. Network
completion callbacks are scheduled on the UI thread and fenced by attachment
generation. An older acknowledgement does not clear a newer open gesture.
Selection preflight owns only the before-states it acquires. Failed batches
release those entries before any display mutation; cancelled moves restore and
release their backgrounds without committing unrelated edits. A new destination
with a separate pending edit is refused. Invalid capture remains a Save fault
until validated replacement; cleanup does not reset the attachment or its pending
acknowledgements. See the
[capture/cancellation verification](../verification/2026-09-06-selection-capture-and-cancellation.md).
`WsMap.Save` refuses unfinished gestures/submissions, captures the executor's
acknowledged state, and reports staging or replacement failures. Close dialogs
honor that result. The mutable display map is not the save authority.

`Editor.ResizeMap` stages local maintenance before changing authority/display.
Each size has a distinct local document identity and retained local executor, so
undo/redo can resume its edit history and stable IDs. Current/target boundary
hashes must match before installation. A separate history-generation key permits
that local resumption; asynchronous attachment generations never rewind. External
attach/detach/close replaces history ownership. Network resize remains unavailable
until the approved owner-only maintenance protocol is implemented. See the
[local resize verification](../verification/2026-09-06-local-resize-and-history.md)
for exact evidence and remaining performance/acceptance limits.

Each editor binds its command history to the map's existing stack ID and stack
lifetime at construction. A tab switch cannot redirect a delayed acknowledgement
or local resize into another map's history. Disposal invalidates the binding even
if the same path is reopened. Popped/discarded commands release captured state;
live history and in-flight callbacks still retain the state they need. See the
[history audit](../verification/2026-09-06-map-history-ownership-and-retention.md).
During pending undo/redo, new accepted edits queue their local history insertion.
Completion finishes the original transition once, then inserts the new branch
in order. Saved-state identity follows the latest applied command; pending history
is modified. Durable edits continue through the executor and Save/close retains
its independent authority checks. See the
[ordering/Save verification](../verification/2026-09-06-history-ordering-and-save.md).

## Target boundaries

```text
Desktop UI ---- local executor -----+
                                     |
Remote client -- WSS transport ------+--> authoritative operation engine
                                     |        -> validation and ordering
HTTP control/snapshot ---------------+        -> revisioned operation log
                                              -> snapshot store
                                              -> atomic DMM/TGM export

Meridian-MCP <---- versioned adapter / diagnostics coordinator
Content Tools <--- OpenAPI and AsyncAPI contracts
Meridian-Rift <-- staged artifact, hashes, then authoritative build gates
```

New Aphelion-owned packages:

- `internal/aphelion/collab/model`: deterministic domain values and operations.
- `internal/aphelion/collab/engine`: validation, ordering, conflict decisions, and inverse operations.
- `internal/aphelion/collab/protocol`: HTTP/WebSocket wire envelopes and version negotiation.
- `internal/aphelion/collab/server`: sessions, presence, authorization, and transports.
- `internal/aphelion/collab/client`: desktop transport and reconciliation.
- `internal/aphelion/collab/store`: snapshots and operation-log persistence.
- `internal/aphelion/integration`: bounded Meridian and content-tools adapters.
- `cmd/apheliondmm-collab`: the collaboration service executable.

## Dependency rules

- `model` depends only on the Go standard library.
- `engine` depends on `model`, not UI, networking, storage, or ImGui.
- `protocol` maps wire data to `model`; wire compatibility does not leak UI types.
- `server` owns operation ordering and publishes accepted revisions from the document loop after durable append. Stores revalidate retained history and incoming accepted records for consistency.
- `client` never mutates the map outside the same executor abstraction used by local mode.
- inherited UI code depends on narrow Aphelion interfaces; Aphelion packages do not depend on concrete ImGui widgets.
- integrations consume versioned contracts and immutable configuration, not shared database tables.

## Concurrency model

Each open document has one authoritative mutation loop. It serializes durable operations and owns the current revision. Network readers, presence updates, persistence, rendering, and telemetry may run concurrently, but they cannot mutate authoritative document state directly.

Engine branches share private immutable snapshot and accepted-operation payloads.
Each branch owns its mutable history maps; validation copies the tile table before
replacing or appending states. Public inputs, outputs and changed tile states are
deep copies. Recovery preserves the same ownership boundary. This reduces
transaction-copy cost without making a single Document safe for concurrent
mutation or changing the server's append-before-publication requirement. See the
[engine-copy verification](../verification/2026-09-06-engine-copy-performance.md).

Private `SessionStore.LoadRecovery` returns the snapshot, retained operations,
revision hashes, and durable head. Recovery verifies them and restores inverse
targets and historical bases, including operations compacted out of public
reconnect replay. Public `Load` retains its snapshot-plus-suffix shape. This
retains full history and has a measurement-backed scaling investigation in the
2026-09-05 performance audit; no bounded-history optimization is implemented.

The UI thread remains the only owner of OpenGL/ImGui work. Applied operations produce immutable render invalidations that are scheduled onto the UI thread.

Clipboard placement reuses the owned Move preview lifecycle and the same local/
network operation engine. The application Paste action starts a preview; it no
longer commits immediately. The tool retains its originating editor, assigns
copied IDs once, and restores/releases only owned destination backgrounds.
Save and competing edits remain guarded until confirmation or cancellation.
Floating rotation/mirroring builds a sparse candidate template, validates all
orientations, then reuses Move's capture-before-restore transaction. Failure
leaves the previous template/display intact. Only final placement submits an
operation; transformed templates preserve clipboard independence and copied IDs.
The [paste-transform report](../verification/2026-09-06-paste-transforms.md)
records actual shortcut, cancellation, fault and local/network history evidence,
plus selected-size model costs without claiming desktop latency improvements.
Preview refresh now restores only passed-over tiles before rebuilding owned
tiles from captured backgrounds; cancellation and return-to-origin still restore
everything. Hidden display instances remain copies, preserving snapshot isolation.
The [preview-copy audit](../verification/2026-09-06-preview-copy-performance.md)
records profile attribution, matched display hashes, allocation savings and mixed
timing results for ordinary Grab movement and floating rotation.
The [application routing and canvas audit](../verification/2026-09-06-canvas-resize-and-application-routing.md)
qualifies shortcut dispatch and workspace focus with a real hidden UI context.
It also removes the redundant CPU canvas-resize upload: texture allocation uses
nil data followed by the existing full framebuffer clear before drawing. Its
pixel-equivalence and synchronized blank-resize measurements do not replace
representative map, GPU-memory or human-interaction qualification.

Search queries use the owned `internal/aphelion/search` helper for a single map
traversal, preserving prefab grouping and tile/instance order. Results reference
current display instances and are not a persistent index. The inherited search
panel clips rows, computes focused-result scrolling before clipping, and stops
iteration when its result generation changes. Free releases result references;
filter changes reset navigation. Search's result generation remains local to the
panel. A separate `Editor.MapViewVersion` fences its cached instance pointers
across local edits, snapshot replacement, resize/history and attachment changes.
Queries rebuild once when invalidated and ready; unfinished gestures defer them.
Automatic same-map refresh retains filter bounds. Stale row/bulk actions refresh
without retargeting their old indices. `CanStartMapEdit` fences mutations, and
`CommitInstanceBatch` verifies membership and captures all targets before display
changes. It also validates the shared replacement through a temporary capture
before installation, rejecting an empty path or missing variable data. Failed
preflight releases only its captures; target-capture faults retain the map guard,
while an invalid selected replacement leaves the unchanged map usable. Later
snapshot-read failures retain valid entered intent for explicit retry. See the
[after-value qualification](../verification/2026-09-06-search-after-values-and-stopping-point.md).
Accepted operations and actor-scoped history keep their existing owners. See the
[ownership/capture qualification](../verification/2026-09-06-search-ownership.md)
and the earlier
[search verification](../verification/2026-09-06-search-performance.md) for exact
query/draw equivalence, allocation tradeoffs and remaining action-lifecycle gates.

## Deployment modes

The shared service package supports these entry points:

- embedded loopback mode in the desktop;
- `cmd/apheliondmm-collab` for local and explicitly enabled LAN service;
- `cmd/apheliondmm-hosted` behind TLS, OIDC, PostgreSQL, backups, and operational monitoring.

Loopback is the default. A deployment mode may strengthen authentication and persistence, but it may not change operation semantics.
